# Day 2: Python Functions & Data Processing Exercises

This folder contains two Python exercises covering **functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, sorting, and formatted output**. Each exercise is implemented in its own `.py` file, and example outputs are attached as images.

---

## Exercise 1 — `exercise_1.py` (Word Frequency Counter)
- Implements a function `word_frequency(text, top_n)` that:
  - Converts text to lowercase  
  - Removes punctuation manually (keeping only letters and spaces)  
  - Splits text into words (list)  
  - Counts frequency of each word (dictionary)  
  - Returns the top `n` most frequent words, sorted in descending order
- Hardcoded paragraph about **World War 2** is analyzed.  
- Prints a formatted report of the **top 5 most common words**.  
- **Output:** ![Exercise 1 Output](output_exercise_1.png)

## Exercise 2 — `exercise_2.py` (Student Report Generator)
- Stores 5 students as a **list of dictionaries**, each with:
  - `name`, `scores` (list of numbers), `subject`
- Implements functions:
  - `calculate_average(scores)` → returns average score  
  - `get_grade(avg)` → returns grade (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`)  
  - `class_topper(students)` → returns the top scorer  
  - `generate_report(students)` → loops through students, computes average & grade, sorts by average (descending), prints formatted report
- Highlights the **top scorer** by adding `'*** TOP ***'` to their row.  
- Prints **student report table** with columns: `Student Name | Average | Grade`.  
- **Output:**

### Difference between List and Dictionary

A **list** stores multiple items in a specific order and is accessed using an index (position).  
It is useful when the sequence of data matters, such as storing marks, names, or prices.
Properties for list data: Mutable, Ordered, Duplicate, and Heterogenous  

A **dictionary** stores data as **key–value pairs** and is accessed using keys instead of positions.  
It is useful for structured data where each value has a label, such as storing a student’s name, age, and marks.

**In short:**  
Use a **list** for ordered collections.  
Use a **dictionary** for labeled or structured data.
